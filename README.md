Python Api for text translations.

This is a simple example to make translations using a local model. The model is taken from Helsinki-NLP - https://huggingface.co/Helsinki-NLP.


To start let's execute

pip install -r requirements.txt

to import 

- flask
- transformers
- sentencepiece
- torch

And then let's execute 

python trapi.py

to start our api running on our localhost at port 5000.

The code it's just an example of what we can do using a few rows of python code.
